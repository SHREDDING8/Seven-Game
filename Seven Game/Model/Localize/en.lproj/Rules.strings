♤ Each player picks up an alcoholic beverage and sits in a circle

♤ The first player flips the card, performs the task and passes the turn to the next player

♤ The player may go to the toilet, as long as he has the 'Eight' in his hands.

♤ The game ends when the deck runs out, but no one forbids starting another round:)";
